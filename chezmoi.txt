init > add  files > push the files to repo

[start of back up]





edit config files normally (nvim config) the local versions
chezmoi diff (will show u what u changed)
chezmoi re-add (will add those changes to the git repo)
git push to back up the current changes
[the most intuitive way]


OR

edit config using chezmoi edit --watch
watch=save the edits to repo once u saave
then git push to save the current changes

[thoguhts]

chezmoi managed to see what file u manage thro edit(by adding them prior)
chezmoi edit --watch (while editor is nvim) file name into alias
alias configedit='chezmoi edit --watch'


[best dotfiles tool not changing it]
THE END
